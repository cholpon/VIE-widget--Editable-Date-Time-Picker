    <h1>VIE Widget - DateTimePicker</h1>
    <h2>How To</h2>
   <article>
    First, we need to include the dependencies in the header:
    <br /><br />
        <pre class="sh_javascript_dom">
...
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src=".../jquery.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src=".../underscore.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src=".../backbone.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src=".../jquery.rdfquery.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src=".../vie-2.0.0.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src=".../jquery-ui.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src=".../moment/kalendae.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src=".../moment/require.js">&lt;/script>

&lt;!--  the current VIE widget -->
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="./vie.widget.dateTimePicker.js">&lt;/script>
...
</pre>
<br />
Now, we can read the embedded <a target="_blank" href="">RDFa</a> annotations from the webpage:
<br /><br />
<pre class="sh_javascript_dom">
    &lt;script type="text/javascript">
      $ (function ()  {
    // initialize a global VIE object
       var vie = window.vie = new VIE({
       baseNamespace: 'http://schema.org/'
    });
    
    vie.loadSchema("http://schema.rdfs.org/all.json", {
        baseNS : "http://schema.org/",
        success: function () {
          vie.use(new vie.RdfaService);
          vie.load({element: jQuery('#content')}).using('rdfa').execute()
              .success(function(entities) {
                  console.log(JSON.stringify(entities));
                  console.log("We got " + entities.length + " editable objects from the page");
              })
              .fail(function (e) {
                  console.warn("failed to load rdfa entities" + e);
              });
        // '#content' is the HTML element that contains text, with which you want to work
        // '#entity-cards' is the HTML element where the widget shows editing process 
        $('#content').vieDatePicker({vie: vie, container: $("#entity-cards"), setFormat: "MM-DD-YYYY"}); 
        },
        error: function (e) {
            console.warn("failed to load schema " + e);
        }
    });
});
</pre>
<br />
We call the widget on the HTML element that contains the annotated text. As arguments the widget expects to get an initialized VIE instance, an HTML element that should show the editing process, and a preferred date format. By default the widget has an American standard: "MM-DD-YYYY", but you can change to your taste.
<br /><br />

<b>User:</b> "OK. So what exactly can the widget do for me?"
<br /><br />
<b>Me:  </b> "DateTimePicker will recognize found entities with their relevant attributes and present to you, once you click on entities that interest you. Information relevant for an entity will be grouped in form of an entity-card.  In it you can see all date-attributes for the entity and also all of its filled-out attributes. Once you decide to change date values, simply click on an input field of the date-attribute and choose the date from the calendar view. The widget will save and update the corresponding values of the entity."
<br /><br />

<b>User:</b> "I see, and what is this message about "Recommended date range"?"
<br /><br />
<b>Me:  </b> "For your convenience, DateTimePicker checks for semantic consistency of date values. It uses <i>Schema</i> ontology and generates a own collection of semantic rules. These rules check for semantic consistency between date attributes of the same entity and also between date attributes of different entities, in case they somehow reference each other. <br/>
For instance, the widget can detect that a production date of the movie should be later that the birth date of the director of the movie. Moreover, if there is a review that references this movie but not its director, the widget will be able to detect the semantic connection that the publishing date of the review cannot be earlier that birth date of the director. If the widget has enough information, it will recommend you to give input data within a certain date range. The date range is only recommended for your personal consideration, you can always input any date you want."
<br /><br />

<b>User:</b> "Great! But the widget now provides the semantic restraints for valid date ranges, based only on <i>Schema</i> ontology. What if I would like to have semantic restraints that work with another ontology?"
<br /><br />
<b>Me:  </b> "At your wish, this is possible! Let me show you how to adjust the widget to work with another collection of rules. First you will need to define your own rules, based on the chosen ontology. The syntax for defining a new rule is very simple. To establish a semantic connection between date attributes of entities, one has to give the type of the first entity, its date-property, label &#60;&#61; or &#62;&#61;, attibute of the entity that serves as reference to the second entity, and second entity's date attribute:"
<br /><br />

<pre class="sh_javascript_dom">
  // defining a new rule
  function Rule(type, date1, label, reference, date2) {
    this.type = type;
    this.date1 = date1;
    this.label = label;
    this.reference = reference;
    this.date2 = date2;
}
</pre>
<br />
<b>Me:</b> "Here is an example of a code, when we specify that any creative work has to have date of creation not earlier than its author's birthday:"
<br /><br />

<pre class="sh_javascript_dom">
  function rulesForCreativeWork() {
  var type = "&#60;http://schema.org/CreativeWork&#62;";
  return &#91;
    new Rule &#40;type, "dateCreated", "&#62;&#61;", "author", "birthDate"&#41;
  &#93;;
}
</pre>

<b>Me:</b> "In case if you want to specify semantic rules between attributes of within entity itself, give "self" as a reference value:"
<br /><br />

<pre class="sh_javascript_dom">
  function rulesForCreativeWork() {
  var type = "&#60;http://schema.org/CreativeWork&#62;";
  return &#91;
    new Rule &#40;type, "datePublished", "&#62;&#61;", "self", "dateCreated"&#41;
  &#93;;
}
</pre>
<br /><br />

<b>Me:</b> "Once you have specified all the rules you want, delete default rules from the source code (lines 348-611 in vie.widget.dateTimePicker.js file), add your new rules on their place and concatenate them in <i>var allRules </i> (line 331 in vie.widget.dateTimePicker.js file). That's all you need to do to work with your own rules."
